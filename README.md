# Mission-To-Mars
![Mars](mission_to_mars.jpg)

## Background
A project designed to show the latest data about Mars on a web page through the use of web scraping, MongoDB, and Flask.

## Getting Started
### Technologies Used

* Jupyter Notebook
* Google Chrome
* Splinter and Selenium
* BeautifulSoup
* Python - Pandas 
* SQL (NoSQL - MongoDB)
* pymongo
* Flask

## Process
### Overall Structure

There are four distinct files for this project: the Jupyter Notebook file (mission_to_mars.ipynb), the converted Python scraper script (scrape_mars.py), the Flask app used to access this converted Python scraper script and to store the scraped data into a MongoDB database (app.py), and the HTML file to display and arrange the data (index.html).

### Jupyter Notebook file - mission_to_mars.ipynb

This file scrapes various types of Mars data through a combination of various tools, as follows:
* Mars news data (https://mars.nasa.gov/news/) via Splinter and BeautifulSoup,
* The JPL Mars featured image (https://www.jpl.nasa.gov/spaceimages/?search=&category=Mars) via Splinter and BeautifulSoup,
* The Mars Weather Report tweet (https://twitter.com/marswxreport?lang=en) via Splinter and BeautifulSoup,
* Mars facts (https://space-facts.com/mars/) via Pandas and BeautifulSoup, and 
* Mars hemisphere images (https://astrogeology.usgs.gov/search/results?q=hemisphere+enhanced&k1=target&v1=Mars) via Splinter and BeautifulSoup.

### Converted Python scraper script - scrape_mars.py

This file has been converted from the above Jupyter Notebook file into a Python script to scrape the above data. A few adjustments were made: 
* Splinter's browser has been made headless for deployment,
* A dictionary compiles the results of various scraping functions adapted from the Jupyter Notebook file, and
* Sleep functions were inserted to ensure proper selection of data.

### Flask app - app.py

This file connects to a MongoDB database and stores the scraped data into it. There are two routes:
* The root route ("/"), which renders the template for the final output (including a button that activates the scraping), and
* The route ("/scrape"), which executes the scraping functions found in scrape_mars.py.

### HTML file - index.html

This file displays the data gathered via the Flask app, and also arranges the data via a CSS/Bootstrap stylesheet.

### Insights

There are many moving parts, and understanding how they work in tandem is key to better understand the effectiveness of Flask.
